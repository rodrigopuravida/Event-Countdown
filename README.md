Event Countdown app, a SwiftUI-based application designed to manage your important events such as holidays, vacations, and birthdays. Users can add upcoming events and see a countdown showing the time remaining for future event, and the time that has passed since each past event.

Why am I building this?
Building the Event Countdown app is an exploration into the depth and breadth of what SwiftUI has to offer, particularly focusing on its latest features and best practices.

View Modifiers: You can style and modify your views to achieve the design you want, enhancing their visual appeal and functionality.
NavigationStack and NavigationLink: Experience firsthand the power of the NavigationStack. Seamlessly push and pop views in your navigation stack, ensuring a fluid and intuitive navigation experience for the users.
Parent-child Communication: Unlock the potential of closures in SwiftUI. Understand how parent views can influence child views and vice versa, facilitating powerful and efficient two-way communication.
State and Observation: Delve into the heart of SwiftUI's dynamic nature. Grasp how to use State properties and Swift's Observation framework to reactively update your UI in response to data changes.
Lists and Swipe Actions: Get hands-on with the List component. Display arrays of data elegantly and introduce swipe actions, allowing users to interact with each row effectively.
Native SwiftUI Components: Unleash the capabilities of native components like ColorPicker, DatePicker, and ImagePicker. These tools offer an out-of-the-box solution, ensuring consistency and reducing development time.
Date Formatting: Discover the art of date presentation. Learn to use DateFormatter to tailor how dates are displayed, enhancing clarity and user comprehension.
Building this countdown management application offers an excellent way to grasp the advanced concepts of SwiftUI. Instead of grappling with abstract ideas, you'll see their real-world applications as you integrate them into your app.
